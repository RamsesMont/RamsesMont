Illustrator of tilesets and assets for videogames, mostly commissioned for RPG Maker projects.
I have illustrated original characters, book covers, portraits and posters.

Among the book covers I have done the covers of the two volumes of "La Vida como un Dragón" (Life as a Dragon) by the writer Alan Akio Simon and my own personal project called "Tsuki Legacy".
